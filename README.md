# MarkovCPP
C++ Class for Simulating Finite Markiv Chains

This C++ class implements a finite Markov chain. It allows to simulate state transitions 
of a Markov chain according to a given matrix of transition probabilities.
It uses a pseudo-random number generator. In particular, it requires the 'RandGen' class that
is made available on GitHub: https://github.com/saiedhk/RandGenCPP.
